An online Sports/E-Sports betting Application

This is a demo application I've written using ASP.NET core 3.1 and React TS. 

This is an application where users place money to make a prediction on a match. 
Each match can have 1 or more predictions, reward for making the right prediction will depend on the odds. 
Paypal's sandbox environment is used for users` money transactions.
